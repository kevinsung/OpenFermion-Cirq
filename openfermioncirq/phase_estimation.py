    """Perform iterative phase estimation.

    This is a method for estimating an eigenvalue e^{2 pi phi} of a unitary U.
    It outputs an estimate of the phase phi along with an approximate
    eigenstate. The inputs are a list of operations for performing
    controlled-U^{2^k}, where k ranges from 0 to m-1, where m is the desired
    number of bits of precision. One should also input an initial state and/or
    operations used to prepare an initial state. If the initial state has a
    large (over 50%) overlap with an eigenstate of U, then with reasonably
    high probability, that eigenstate and its phase will be returned. The
    probability of this result occurring can be amplified by requesting that
    certain bits of the phase be measured to a higher accuracy through the
    `repetitions` argument. Since the less significant bits contribute more
    to the failure probbility, they should be prioritized; for instance,
    a reasonable value for `repetitions` would be [17, 9, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1].

    Implementation based on arXiv:quant-ph/0610214.

    Args:
        controlled_unitaries: A list of operations that act on the given ancilla
            and system qubits, where the ancilla is treated as the control
            qubit. The k-th OP_TREE in the list performs controlled-U^{2^k},
            where U is the unitary whose eigenvalue is to be estimated.
        initial_state: The initial state of the system qubits. Must be safely
            castable to dtype numpy.complex64.
        preparation_ops: Any operations that should be applied to the initial
            state of the system qubits.
        repetitions: If an integer, specifies the number of times to measure
            each bit of the output before moving on to the next stage. If a
            sequence of integers, then the k-th integer specifies the number of
            times to measure the k-th least significant bit before moving on.
        simulator: The simulator to use.
